# zapq-desktop
Easy desktop extension to drag'n'drop a file to compress or decompress it.

Simply drag'n'drop a file onto the zpaq-desktop.bat file and it will automatically detect if it is a zpaq file or not. If a zpaq file is detected it will be decompressed and if none is detected it will compress the file. Compressed and decompressed files are placed in the origin directory of the file that is processed.
